# Qsim

## Requirements
- cudatoolkit
- cupy

This package is currently only compatible with Cuda capible machines, and requires ```cupy``` to work. There are compatibility requirements between cudatoolkit, cupy, and the gpu you are running them on, so manual installation of these packages is required.

If you are installing this package on a Google Colab runtime with GPU acceleration, then necessary gpu packages should already be installed.
## Installation
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rDanielNutt/Qsim.git
```
